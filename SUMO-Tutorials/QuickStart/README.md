## Example Description


Origins:

The red circles labeled 91, 92, 93, 94 represent the origin points.
Destinations:

The red circles labeled 911, 912, 913, 914 represent the destination points.
Unsignalized Intersections:

The two brown areas in the center of the network represent intersections without traffic signals (6, 3).
These are locations where roads intersect, but traffic flow is managed without signals.
Other Brown Areas:

Points 1 and 2: Entry points from north and south, likely serving as merging or transition zones.

Points 3 and 4: Entry points from east and west, directing traffic into the main intersections
Three lanes per outbound road:

The main roads in the image have three lanes, indicated by directional arrows.
Example: D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8 represent outbound roads.
Restricted lane movements:

Multiple arrows indicate movement restrictions per lane.
U-turn prohibition:

No U-turn arrows are present at intersections, confirming U-turns are prohibited.
East-West traffic priority:

Eastbound and westbound roads have more lanes or priority rules.
Roads L1, L2, L7, L8 may be prioritized.
